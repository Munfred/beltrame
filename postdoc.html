<h1 class="page__title" itemprop="headline">Searching for a Postdoctoral Scholar to work in Single Cell Computational Biology!</h1>

<p>Ol√°! My name is Eduardo da Veiga Beltrame,  am an Assistant Professor of Computational Biology at <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/">MBZUAI</a> in Abu Dhabi. I completed my PhD in Bioengineering at Caltech, where I focused on computational and experimental method development for single cell omics. You can read more about me at <a href="https://munfred.com">munfred.com</a>.</p>

<p>I am currently recruiting a postdoctoral scholar to work with me at MBZUAI in Abu Dhabi on the development of computational methods and tools focusing on single cell omics data. Interest in collaboration, teaching and mentorship experience is highly valuable, as the MBZUAI computational biology department is very new, and we are in the intial steps of organizing many teaching and research initiatives in computational biology. </p>

<p>For more details on my academic philosophy and research interests, see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sXQdC-210cf1rjBfXA00Gn8MyIZFDJZ78IwncR6Bvg8/edit?usp=sharing">these statements</a> I wrote suring my academic job search, and take a look at my <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAGDB0KIrCM/_EP_uuAKdCrV8SZtik-zTA/view"> May 2024 research talk</a>.

<p>The compensation for a postdoctoral scholar at MBUZAI is about USD 105,450 per year, plus benefits. There is no income tax in the United Arab Emirates. You can expect to spend 20-30% of your income on rent, leave ample disposable income. If moving to Abu Dhabi to work in single cell omics computational biology interests you, do not hesitate to write to me at <u>eduardo.beltrame@mbzuai.ac.ae</u>. Please include two or three pages describing yourself, your work and research interests (pictures are encouraged), and let's find a time to chat!</p>
