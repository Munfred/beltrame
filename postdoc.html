<h1 class="page__title" itemprop="headline">Searching for a postdoc in single cell computational biology!</h1>

<h2 class="page__title" itemprop="headline"> Looking for a Postdoctoral Scholar! </h2>

<p>Olá! My name is Eduardo da Veiga Beltrame, I was born and raised in <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/6y9cPBWRwAA5YJaa7"> Florianópolis</a>, Brazil. I am an Assistant Professor of Computational Biology at <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/">MBZUAI</a> in Abu Dhabi. I completed my PhD in Bioengineering at Caltech, where I focused on computational and experimental method development for single cell omics. Before joining MBZUAI I was a founding scientist at <a href="https://retro.bio/">Retro Biosciences</a>, a biotechnology startup focused on aging biology, and bioinformatics lead at <a href="https://imyoo.health/">ImYoo</a>, a biotechnology startup leveraging single cell omics to advance patient-centric precision medicine.</p>

<p>I am currently recruiting a postdoctoral scholar to work with me at MBZUAI in Abu Dhabi on the development of computational methods and tools focusing on single cell omics data. Interest in collaboration, teaching and mentorship experience is highly valuable, as the MBZUAI computational biology department is very new, and we are in the intial steps of organizing many teaching and research initiatives in computational biology. </p>


<p>For more details on my academic philosophy and research interests, see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sXQdC-210cf1rjBfXA00Gn8MyIZFDJZ78IwncR6Bvg8/edit?usp=sharing">these statements</a> I wrote suring my academic job search, and take a look at my <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAGDB0KIrCM/_EP_uuAKdCrV8SZtik-zTA/view"> May 2024 research talk</a>.

<p>The compensation for a postdoctoral scholar at MBUZAI is about USD 105,450 per year, and there is no income tax. If moving to Abu Dhabi interests you, please write to me at <u>eduardo.beltrame at mbzuai.ac.ae</u>. Please include two or three pages describing yourself, your work and research interests (pictures are encouraged), and let's find a time to chat!</p>
